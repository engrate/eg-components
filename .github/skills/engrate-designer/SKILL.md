# Engrate Brand Guidelines

## 1. Manifesto & Brand Strategy

### Core Message

- We solve problems – preferably the biggest ones we can find
- Everything starts and ends with energy
- We're building a platform that makes the transition to sustainability faster, more democratic, and more profitable
- Our overarching goal: to become the global standard for energy data

### Tone of Voice

- Problem-solving and action-oriented
- Forward-looking without dismissing existing systems
- AI as an enabler for handling complexity
- Balance between technical capability and human connections

---

## 2. Logo

### Structure

- **Wordmark:** Typeface Granjon (100+ years old)
  - Represents the old energy world
- **Symbol:** Three overlapping diamonds
  - Symbolizes interacting technology
  - Creates something greater than the sum of its parts

### Usage

- Primary logo should be used as the standard version
- The combination of old (Granjon) and new (diamonds) must always be maintained

---

## 3. Colors

### 3.1 Primary Color: Sunflower (Hero Color)

**#FFBE26**

- CMYK: C:0, M:27, Y:94, K:0
- HEX: #FFBE26

**Usage:**

- Should be used when only one color can be chosen
- Inspired by the eternal power of the sun
- Represents balance in energy perspective (between green and red spectrum)
- The most powerful color in the identity

**Philosophy:**

- The sun is the prerequisite for all energy
- Yellow represents balance in the energy spectrum (between green and red)
- Balances elegantly in the middle

---

### 3.2 Secondary Colors (Yellow Spectrum)

**CRITICAL RULE:** All colors work as individual, strong, and complementary colors – **NEVER** as tints or fades.

| Color              | HEX     | Usage                          |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Sunflower**      | #FFBE26 | Primary, always starting point |
| **Lemon Meringue** | #FFF8A2 | Supporting, background fields  |
| **Vanilla**        | #FFFCD0 | Supporting, background fields  |
| **Eggshell**       | #FFFDE8 | Supporting, background fields  |

**Important:** Creates a world of nuances in the same emotional space

---

### 3.3 Grayscale

**Primary Function:**

- Should be the **most used** "color" in the identity
- Creates clear hierarchies, navigation, and logic **without using color**
- Makes the colors look their absolute best

**CRITICAL PROPORTION RULE:**

- **10% color vs 90% grayscale**
- This is when colors look their absolute best
- Deviations from this rule weaken the visual identity

**Function:**

- Variations created to allow clear hierarchies
- Grayscale makes the small, intense color splashes maximally impactful

**Defined Grayscale Colors:**

| Usage                      | HEX     | Description                    |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Text Primary**           | #1A1A1A | All main text, headings        |
| **Text Secondary**         | #4A4A4A | Body text, descriptions        |
| **Text Tertiary**          | #6A6A6A | Labels, meta information       |
| **Main Background**        | #FAFAFA | Primary page background        |
| **Alternative Background** | #F5F5F5 | Sections, alternative surfaces |
| **Cards/Modules**          | #F9F9F9 | Cards, containers              |
| **Contrast Background**    | #EFEFEF | When extra contrast is needed  |
| **Line Color**             | #E5E5E5 | Borders, dividers              |

**IMPORTANT - Background Colors:**

- **NEVER** use pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- **ALWAYS** use very light gray background
- Recommended background colors: #FAFAFA, #F5F5F5, #F9F9F9
- This subtle gray tone creates warmth and softness
- Provides better contrast for color accents

**IMPORTANT - Background Fields:**

- Use light gray (#FAFAFA, #F5F5F5, #F9F9F9) OR light yellow (#FFFCD0, #FFFDE8) shades for background fields
- These create subtle separations without dominating
- Choose based on desired feeling: gray for neutrality, yellow for energy

---

### 3.4 Complementary Colors

**CRITICAL USAGE RULES:**

- Should be used with **GREAT CAUTION**
- Can **NEVER** have greater presence than the Hero color spectrum (yellow)
- Secondary function only

| Color         | HEX     | Name          |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Warm Purple   | #721B5D | Warm purple   |
| Cool Purple   | #9B4ED8 | Cool purple   |
| Electric Blue | #0080FF | Electric blue |
| Deep Blue     | #002FA7 | Deep blue     |

---

## 4. Typography

### 4.1 Type Hierarchy

**CRITICAL RULE - When to use Libre Baskerville:**

- **Libre Baskerville** should ONLY be used for **really large headings** (60pt and up)
- This is typically large hero headings, landing page headings, main headings in print materials
- Creates distinct visual identity for the most important headings
- Represents combination of tradition and modernity
- Gives weight and authority to main messages

**Work Sans:**

- Used for all headings under 60pt (H2, H3, H4, H5)
- Used for all body text
- Used for labels and meta information
- This is the default choice for typography

**Summary:**

- **Libre Baskerville**: Only large hero headings (≥60pt)
- **Work Sans**: Everything else (headings <60pt, body text, labels)

---

### 4.2 Primary Typeface: Libre Baskerville (Only Large Hero Headings)

**Usage Area:** ONLY really large hero headings (60pt and up)

#### Large Hero Headings

| Level   | Size  | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Weight  |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Hero H1 | 60pt+ | 60pt        | -2%            | Regular |

**ABSOLUTE RULE:**

- Libre Baskerville may ONLY be used for headings that are 60pt or larger
- Libre Baskerville may NEVER be used for body text, labels, or smaller headings

---

### 4.3 Secondary Typeface: Work Sans (Standard for Everything Else)

**Usage Area:** All headings under 60pt, body text, labels

#### Headings

| Level         | Size | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Weight  |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| H1 (Standard) | 40pt | 41pt        | -4%            | Regular |
| H2            | 30pt | 32pt        | -3%            | Regular |
| H3            | 25pt | 27pt        | -2%            | Regular |
| H4            | 25pt | 27pt        | -1%            | Regular |

#### Body Text

| Type                 | Size | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Weight  | Color              |
| -------------------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| **Lead**             | 20pt | 22pt        | -2%            | Regular | #1A1A1A or #4A4A4A |
| **Semi-Lead**        | 15pt | 24pt        | 0%             | Regular | #4A4A4A            |
| **Large Body**       | 12pt | 15pt        | +1%            | Regular | #4A4A4A            |
| **Body**             | 10pt | 13pt        | +2%            | Regular | #4A4A4A            |
| **Descriptive Text** | 8pt  | 14pt        | +4%            | Regular | #4A4A4A or #6A6A6A |

#### Labels & Meta Information

| Type            | Size | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Weight  | Color   |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Large Label** | 8pt  | 16pt        | +8%            | Regular | #6A6A6A |
| **Small Label** | 5pt  | 12pt        | +14%           | Regular | #6A6A6A |

**CRITICAL RULE - Work Sans Weight:**

- **NEVER** use pure black (#000000) or other colors for text

---

## 5. UI Elements

### 5.1 Buttons

**CRITICAL RULE - Button Corners:**

- Buttons should **ALWAYS** have fully rounded corners
- Border-radius should be 50% of button height or 9999px
- This creates pill-form (capsule form)
- NEVER square or slightly rounded corners

**Button Styles:**

| Element            | Specification                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Background**     | #FFBE26 (Sunflower)             |
| **Text**           | Work Sans Regular, 15pt         |
| **Text Color**     | #1A1A1A (Text Primary)          |
| **Padding**        | 16px vertical, 40px horizontal  |
| **Border-radius**  | 9999px (fully rounded)          |
| **Letter-spacing** | 0%                              |
| **Hover Effect**   | Background #E5AB22, slight lift |

**Examples:**

```
Primary button: Yellow background (#FFBE26), dark gray text (#1A1A1A), rounded form
Secondary button: Transparent with yellow border, dark gray text, rounded form
```

## 6. Layout Principles

### 6.1 Basic Layout Philosophy

**Engrate = Clarity built on precision**

### 6.2 Text Alignment

**RULE:** Always left-aligned text

- Prioritize left alignment in all typography
- Creates clarity and readability

### 6.3 Hierarchies

**CRITICAL SIZE RULE:**

- Really large headings (≥60pt) should be in **Libre Baskerville**
- All other headings should be in **Work Sans**
- Heading should be **at least twice as large** as body text
- Clear, unambiguous hierarchies
- Use labels for meta information

### 6.4 Margins and Grid System

**Basic Principle: Even margins**

- Equal margins to **top** and **left side**
- Creates natural squares in the layout

### 6.5 Heading Layout

**Two approved positions:**

1. **Vertical centering:** Heading centered vertically
2. **Top alignment:** Heading aligned to top (with correct margin)

### 6.6 Body Text Positioning

**Allowed variation:**

- Body text can have large gap from heading
- Creates breathing room and visual balance

### 6.7 Meta Text Positioning

**Placement:**

- Near bottom
- At the sides
- Functions as anchor points

### 6.8 Corner Alignment

**Principle:**

- Prioritize alignment to different corners
- Creates structure and order in layout

---

## 7. Backgrounds & Color Fields

### 7.1 Background Colors

**CRITICAL RULE:**

- **NEVER** use pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- **ALWAYS** use very light gray or light yellow shades

**Recommended Backgrounds:**

| Usage                      | HEX     | Description                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Background**        | #FAFAFA | Primary page background (light gray)        |
| **Alternative Background** | #F5F5F5 | Sections, alternative surfaces (light gray) |
| **Cards/Modules**          | #F9F9F9 | Cards, containers (light gray)              |
| **Contrast Background**    | #EFEFEF | When extra contrast is needed (light gray)  |

**Advantages of Light Gray:**

- Creates warmth and softness
- Reduces eye strain
- Provides better contrast for color accents
- Feels more premium than pure white

### 7.2 Color Fields for Separation

**CRITICAL RULE - Background Fields:**

- Use **light gray** (#FAFAFA, #F5F5F5, #F9F9F9, #EFEFEF) OR **light yellow** (#FFFCD0, #FFFDE8) shades
- These colors are used to create subtle separations between sections
- Choose color based on desired feeling:
  - **Light gray**: Neutrality, professionalism, standard
  - **Light yellow**: Energy, optimism, highlighting

**Recommended Color Fields:**

| Color                | HEX             | Usage                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Vanilla**          | #FFFCD0         | Highlighting sections, accents         |
| **Eggshell**         | #FFFDE8         | Subtle color fields, soft highlighting |
| **Light Gray Field** | #FAFAFA-#F5F5F5 | Neutral separation                     |

**Examples:**

```
Hero section: #FFFDE8 background (light yellow)
Product card: #F9F9F9 background (light gray)
Accent area: #FFFCD0 background (vanilla)
Standard section: #FAFAFA background (light gray)
```
